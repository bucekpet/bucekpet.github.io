# After [Final Boss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Beast) – [Frenzied Flame Ending](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Endings#lordoffrenziedflame) only

- If you would like to complete all of the endings, copy your save data after completing the [final boss](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Beast), but before making any kind of choice. You can sit at the Site of Grace. Only complete the following step for the [Frenzied Flame Ending](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Endings#lordoffrenziedflame).
- ***** Go to the very base of Lyndell’s sewers, where you fought Mohg, The Omen. Roll into the altar behind the chest. Make your way to the bottom and talk to Hyetta, following her instructions and exhausting her dialogue. If you did not complete Hyetta's questline, you can still go through the door by taking off all of your armor .
- You do miss out on some dialogue with Melina if you make this choice late game, as Melina is no longer available. If you do this earlier in the game, you are able to select "Talk to Melina" at the Frenzied Flame Proscription Grace before and after interacting with the Frenzied Flame.
- SPOILERS - Becoming the Frenzied Flame before using the Forge of the Giants is the only way to make it so that Melina lives until the end of the game. If you continue with the [Frenzied Flame ending](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Endings#lordoffrenziedflame), Melina will then show up in a cutscene in the ending. Or, you can become the Frenzied Flame early to save Melina, and then use Miquella's needle from Milicent's quest in [Crumbling Farum Azula](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Crumbling+Farum+Azula) to undo it.
